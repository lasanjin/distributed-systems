## Simple distributed blackboard

### Description
We developed a simple distributed blackboard that runs on several machines.

### Solution
 - Clients post to any server using a web browser
 - All received data is stored on the local blackboard
 - Newly received data is propagated to all the other boards in a peer-to-peer manner
