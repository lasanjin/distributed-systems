# Distributed Systems

## Description
Lab assignments during Distributed Systems course at Chalmers. We developed and evaluated a distributed blackboard over a network on Mininet with local virtual machines. We improved the blackboard to make it more consistent, fault-torelant, efficient and reliable by implementing different algorithms. Most work was done in the `server.py` file.
