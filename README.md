# Distributed Systems

## Description
Lab assignments and notes from Distributed Systems course at Chalmers. 

We developed and evaluated a distributed blackboard over a network on Mininet with local virtual machines. We improved the blackboard to make it more consistent, fault-torelant, efficient and reliable by implementing different algorithms. All work was done in the `server.py` files.

### Provided material
 - HTML files
 - Mininet script
   
### How to run
 - [Install Mininet](https://github.com/lasanjin/notes/blob/master/code/TOOLS.md)
 - Run `sudo python lab1.py`
